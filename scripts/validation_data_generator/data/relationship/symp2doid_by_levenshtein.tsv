The sounds are caused by the 'popping open' of small airways and alveoli collapsed by fluid, exudate, or lack of aeration during expiration. The word 'rales' derives from the French word rale meaning 'rattle'. Rales can be heard in patients with pneumonia, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, acute bronchitis, or bronchiectasis. Pulmonary edema secondary to left-sided congestive heart failure can also cause rales.	A chronic asthma that is characterized by significant decline in pulmonary function and increase of airway inflammation at night. During sleep, recumbent posture causes a reduction in the lung volumes, respiratory muscle tone, and lung compliance. The overnight physiological abnormalities include: increased airway inflammation and decreased steroid responsiveness, increased pulmonary capillary blood volume, functional differences in blood/air volume ratios and mechanical coupling of the parenchyma to the airways.	levenshtein	0.4975845217704773

Pulmonary edema secondary to left-sided congestive heart failure can also cause rales.	A central nervous system disease that is characterized by a collection of pus (infected material) between the outer covering of the brain and spinal cord and the bones of the skull or spine and is caused by infection in the area between the bones of the skull or spine, and the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges).	levenshtein	0.4972066879272461

Pulmonary edema secondary to left-sided congestive heart failure can also cause rales.	A filariasis that is characterized by the thickening of the skin and underlying tissues, especially in the legs, male genitals and female breasts, caused by thread-like parasitic worms Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi or Brugia timori, which inhabit the lymphatics. These nematodes are transmitted by mosquitoes. Acute symptoms include fever, lymphadenitis, lymphangitis, funiculitis, and epididymitis. Chronic symptoms include abscesses, hyperkeratosis, polyarthritis, hydroceles, lymphedema, and elephantiasis.	levenshtein	0.4944881796836853

Pulmonary edema secondary to left-sided congestive heart failure can also cause rales.	A deep keratitis that is characterized by inflammation of the anterior sclera and subsequent inflammation of the adjacent cornea with opacification of the corneal stroma and has symptom pain, red eyes, photophobia, tearing, and blurry vision. Sclerosing keratitis is caused by severe anterior scleritis that causes inflammation and injury to the adjacent corneal layer.

Pulmonary edema secondary to left-sided congestive heart failure can also cause rales.	A bronchial disease that is a chronic inflammatory condition of one or more bronchi or bronchioles marked by dilatation and loss of elasticity of the walls resulting from damage to the airway wall leading to the formation of small sacs on the bronchial wall and impairment of cilia mobility in the lung. Inflammation of the bronchial wall increases mucus secretion which serves as a breeding ground for bacteria. Bronchiectasis is caused by repeated respiratory infections, immune deficiency disorders, hereditary disorders (cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia), mechanical factors (inhaled object or a lung tumor) or inhaling toxic substances.	levenshtein	0.49964308738708496

One experiences difficulty evacuating the stool and often has to strain or press the fingers into the vagina or in front of or into the rectum to help remove the stool. Outlet dysfunction can be caused by inappropriate or abnormal muscle contraction of the pelvic floor (called pelvic floor dyssynergia or dyssynergic defecation) which can respond to biofeedback. It may also be due to a rectocele or other structural changes in the pelvic floor that will require medical or at times, surgical treatment.	A chronic asthma that is characterized by significant decline in pulmonary function and increase of airway inflammation at night. During sleep, recumbent posture causes a reduction in the lung volumes, respiratory muscle tone, and lung compliance. The overnight physiological abnormalities include: increased airway inflammation and decreased steroid responsiveness, increased pulmonary capillary blood volume, functional differences in blood/air volume ratios and mechanical coupling of the parenchyma to the airways.	levenshtein	0.489378422498703

A congenital myopathy that is characterized by severe congenital weakness usually resulting in death from respiratory failure in the first year or so of life and that has material basis in heterozygous mutation in the ACTA1 gene on chromosome 1q42. Heterozygous mutation in the ACTA1 gene can also cause autosomal dominant typical congenital myopathy-2A (CMYP2A).

A scleral disease that is characterized by a painless severe necrotizing scleritis where the sclera is white, avascular, and thin. The choroid can become exposed leading to infarction and necrosis of related areas; the sclera can also thin such that the dark uvea protrudes through the front of the eye, forming a staphyloma which has symptom loss of vision and appearance of a dark bulge.

A deep keratitis that is characterized by inflammation of the anterior sclera and subsequent inflammation of the adjacent cornea with opacification of the corneal stroma and has symptom pain, red eyes, photophobia, tearing, and blurry vision. Sclerosing keratitis is caused by severe anterior scleritis that causes inflammation and injury to the adjacent corneal layer.
