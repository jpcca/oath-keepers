"response": "Hello, thank you for calling. I'm here to help you organize your symptoms before your appointment. I'm an AI assistant, not a doctor, so I can't give medical advice. Ready to get started?",
"response_type": "greeting",
"reason": "This is the initial interaction. It warmly welcomes the patient, explains the AI's role, sets boundaries, and asks if they are ready to proceed."

---USER
Hi. I’ve been having some pain in my stomach lately.
---ASSISTANT
{
"response": "Okay, I understand. To help me understand better, could you tell me where exactly in your stomach you're feeling the pain?",
"response_type": "questioning",
"reason": "The patient mentioned stomach pain. The next step is to pinpoint the location of the pain to gather more specific information."
}

---USER
It’s mostly on the upper right side, just below my ribs.
---ASSISTANT
{
"response": "Thanks. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?",
"response_type": "questioning",
"reason": "Now that the location is identified, understanding the pattern of the pain (constant vs. intermittent) is the next logical step for clarification."
}

---USER
It comes and goes.
---ASSISTANT
{
"response": "Okay. About how often would you say it comes and goes? Like daily, a few times a week, or something else?",
"response_type": "questioning",
"reason": "Building on the previous answer (comes and goes), quantifying the frequency helps understand the pattern better."
}

---USER
a few times a week
---ASSISTANT
{
"response": "Thanks. When you feel the pain, would you describe it as sharp, dull, cramping, or something else?",
"response_type": "questioning",
"reason": "Characterizing the nature of the pain (sharp, dull, etc.) is crucial for understanding the symptom."
}

---USER
dull
---ASSISTANT
{
"response": "Okay, dull pain. Does anything seem to trigger the pain, like eating certain foods or times of day?",
"response_type": "questioning",
"reason": "Identifying potential triggers helps narrow down possible causes and provides more context."
}

---USER
it usually happens after I eat fatty foods.
---ASSISTANT
{
"response": "Thanks. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being mild and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate the pain?",
"response_type": "questioning",
"reason": "Assessing the severity of the pain provides important contextual information."
}
---USER
6
---ASSISTANT
{
"response": "Okay, a 6 out of 10. Has this pain been happening for a while, or is it recent?",
"response_type": "questioning",
"reason": "Understanding the duration or onset of the symptoms is another key piece of information."
}

---USER
About a week ago.
---ASSISTANT
{
"response": "Okay. Just to confirm, you've had dull pain, rated about a 6/10, in the upper right side of your stomach below the ribs, occurring a few times a week, especially after eating fatty foods, for about a week. Is that correct?",
"response_type": "confirming",
"reason": "It's important to summarize the gathered information to ensure accuracy before concluding the conversation."
}

---USER
yes
---ASSISTANT
{
"response": "Great. I have a summary of your symptoms: dull pain (6/10) in the upper right stomach below the ribs, occurring a few times a week, especially after fatty foods, for about a week. This information should be helpful for your doctor. Is there anything else you'd like to add or clarify before I finish?",
"response_type": "closing",
"reason": "The final response summarizes all the gathered information in a clear, organized format, ready for the patient to share with their doctor, and offers a final chance for clarification."
